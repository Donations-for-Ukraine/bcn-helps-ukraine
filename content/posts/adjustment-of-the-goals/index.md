It's been some time since we sent the Drone and Heated Insoles.
Unfortunately, in time, we could not gather the needed amount for the second drone.
As you know, the goals and needs change fast during the war, especially on the battlefield.

During conversations with "Golub", he mentioned that the squad needs Portable Power Stations and that they have recently got drones from another volunteer.
The portable power station is a battery or a power bank with a large capacity and high output that allows it not only to charge phones, laptops, and drones but also to power Starlink or other electric devices.
We've discussed the requirements for the Portable Power Stations, and he explained the squad's needs when working in the field.

We've selected a couple of options and will be able to buy them as soon as we gather enough funds.

We plan to close this goal in the next few days, and this time we will purchase everything directly in Ukraine as the prices for Portable Power Stations are even lower than in Spain, and they are available in stock right now.

Please join us! If we get extra funds - we will purchase Portable Solar Panels that allow recharging the Powers stations directly on the field!
