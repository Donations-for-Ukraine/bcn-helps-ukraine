In mid-June, I got the first request from the soldier (call sign "Golub") who was already a couple of months serving in ZSU defending Ukraine at that time.

His squad needed to buy dual-band DMR radio stations (those are digital and support the encryption of the signal) with weather resistance and good battery capacity. "Golub" proposed a couple of options, and we chose one that met all of the requirements and was affordable.

We've aimed to collect money for seven units, order them to Spain, and ship from here to the city closest to "Golub"'s dislocation.

So we set the goal and started sharing the message and asking people to donate.
