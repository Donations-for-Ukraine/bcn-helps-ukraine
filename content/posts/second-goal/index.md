We are setting the second goal, which would be a bit more ambitious than the first one.

This time the soldier (call sign "Golub") and his squad asked to help them buy drones.

In modern combat, drones are the eyes of the soldiers, and they are not only providing intel data but also helping in a variety of other operations.

One of the drones available on the market and proven to be most effective on the field is **DJI Mavic 3**. Even though drones are high-speed and practical, they are often shut down and must be replaced.

The second goal we are aiming for is to buy five drones, but as the squad urgently needs them, we will purchase and ship each unit as soon as we collect enough money.
