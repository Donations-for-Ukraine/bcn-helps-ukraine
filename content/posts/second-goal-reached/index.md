We've ordered the DJI Mavic 3 Drone with a couple of memory cards and a cardholder.

The winters in Ukraine sometimes get very cold, so "Golub" and his squad asked us for heated insoles that prevent soldiers from hypothermia and frostbite of the toes. Some of the soldiers in the squad already struggled with frostbite issues, leading to terrible consequences.

As soon as everything arrived, I had to send it to Ukraine, and one week later, it reached the squad in Ukraine.
