In less than two weeks, we collected the needed amount of money and ordered the radio stations.

As we accumulated a little bit more money than was needed, I asked the soldiers what else they needed at that moment.

They've mentioned that they need extra gloves and that tactical backpacks are always helpful, so we spent the rest of the money on tactical gloves and one tactical bag.

As soon as everything arrived, I had to send it to Ukraine, and one week later, it reached the squad in Ukraine.
