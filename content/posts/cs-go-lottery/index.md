**Oleksandr "petr1k" Petryk** is a Ukrainian [esports journalist and analyst](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Petr1k). He is a well-known person in the Ukrainian esports community and particularly in CS:GO ([Counter Strike: Global Offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive)) community. Apart from commenting and analyzing CS:GO events, he is also active on [his YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/petr1k) and [his Telegram Chanel](https://t.me/petr1ktv).
During the war, Petr1k established a great activity called "Lottery from Petr1k". It is a lottery where he is gathering money for ZSU (Armed Forces of Ukraine) in exchange for a chance to win one of the CS:GO skins (In-game items that change the look of the game weapons). Let me explain the idea in a bit more in detail:

- Anybody can donate skins to be ruffled during these lotteries;
- Volunteers who are helping ZSU (Armed Forces of Ukraine) contact Oleksandr to help them to collect money;
- Oleksandr does the fact-checking and plans the lottery dedicated to one particular goal and the prize pool (Different skins or equipment that was donated);
- Then lottery gets announced in [petr1k Telegram Chanel](https://t.me/petr1ktv);
- After the lottery is finished and the prices are sent to the winners, Oleksandr donates all the gathered money to the volunteers who requested them and makes a post with the result in his Telegram Chanel;

It's a marvelous initiative! Petr1k already had 40+ lotteries and gathered 93000+ EUR in total! 100% of the gathered money where donated to the need of ZSU (Armed Forces of Ukraine).

We've asked Oleksandr for collaboration to help us gather money for our DJI Drones. One of our team members was playing CS:GO and had some Skins in his inventory, so we decided to donate all of them to formate the lottery prize pool. Oleksandr was happy to help us and even extended the price pool with additional items. [Here is a link to the lottery](https://t.me/petr1ktv/1943)
Within less than a week, **172 people** participated in the lottery with a total donation of **1745 EUR**.

With all the donations that we received before + the help of Oleksandr's lottery, and all the participants, we were able to buy the first DJI Mavic 3 Drone.
Big Thanks to everyone who participated!
